# IEC-ST-SparkplugB-for-MQTT

SparkplugB is truly unique and offers a modern, free and open way for any of your devices to exchange data using MQTT as a basis. 
By exploiting the scalability of MQTT and adding a well wefined payload to the MQTT contents, the protocol provides you a flexible architecture. It allows you to auto-discover Nodes, Devices and their Data (Metrics). By combining the properties of the existing MQTT infrastructure and the Sparkplug payload definition, this is the most flexible and powerful protocol out there. You can add or remove nodes/devices on the fly. Whether your devices are state-of-the-art or legacy, this protocol is able to handle all types of devices. Last but not least, your data can be delivered securely and with rich meta data for added context.

Since this is a CODESYS based library, a TwinCAT translation is planned, and any help or assistance is welcomed!
